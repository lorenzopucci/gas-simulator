# GaS Simulator

GaS Simulator is a web application to simulate past italian team math contests from [phiquadro.it](https://phiquadro.it).
Users can clone past contests and add new teams to them. These extra teams can then interact with the contest by
submitting answers, while the real teams' activity is replayed.

A deployment of this application is publicly available on [gas.vercelle.si](https://gas.vercelle.si).

## Technical details
